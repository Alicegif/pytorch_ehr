# Pytorch_ehr

* Predictive analytics on EHR cerner data using Pytorch library;
* Models built: Logistic Regression with embedding dimension 1 and 2, Vanilla RNN, RNN with GRU, RNN with LSTM, Bidirectional RNN, Dialated RNN; 
* The framework has modularized components for models, data loading and processing, and training, validation and test, main file for parsing arguments;
* Bayesian Optimization implemented for hyperparameters search for models, both locally using open source BayesianOptimization package and SigOpt software; 
* Other experiments for visualizations, 
* Data used: Cerner, with 15815 unique medical codes.
