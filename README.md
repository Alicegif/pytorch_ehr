# Pytorch_ehr

* Predictive analytics on EHR cerner data using pytorch library;
* Models built: baseline Logistic Regression, CNN, dialated CNN, RNN, Bidirectional RNN, Dialated RNN, TCN, WaveNet; 
* The framework has modularized components for models, data loading and processing, and training;
* Bayesian Optimization implemented for hyperparameter search for all models; 
* Data used: Cerner, with 15815 unique medical codes.
